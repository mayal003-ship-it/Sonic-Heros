		<p>Sonic Heroes is a 3D platformer video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, released in late 2003 in Japan and Korea, and in early 2004 in the rest of the world. It is noteworthy for being the first multi-console Sonic title, following Sega's transition to a third-party developer after the Dreamcast's discontinuation.</p>
		<p>The game introduces a team-based gameplay mechanic where players control three characters from a team, each with unique abilities: Speed for high-speed platforming, Fly for aerial navigation, and Power for combat. Four different teams are featured, each with distinct level styles: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles) offers standard difficulty levels; Team Rose (Amy, Cream, and Big) provides beginner-friendly challenges; Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge, and E-123 Omega) includes more challenging levels focused on combat; and Team Chaotix (Espio, Charmy, Vector) involves missions centered around finding specific objects. The narrative unfolds with Dr. Eggman's plan to conquer the world with a secret weapon, with Team Sonic trying to thwart him, Team Rose searching for their missing friends, Team Dark uncovering Eggman's secrets, and Team Chaotix investigating various occurrences for a mysterious client.</p>
		<p>Heroes began development in late 2002, led by Takashi Iizuka and Yuji Naka. The project was handled by Sonic Team USA (later Sega Studio USA), a San Francisco-based division of Sonic Team. The shift to multi-platform development presented numerous challenges, including adapting to different hardware and managing tight deadlines. The team utilized the RenderWare engine to facilitate porting across platforms.</p>
		<p>Despite polarizing critics, who praised the style and concept but criticized unsolved problems from prior games and voice acting, Sonic Heroes was a commercial success. It sold over five million copies and was a best-seller on all of the consoles it was released on. As part of the PlayStation 2 Classics program, the PlayStation 2 version was re-released digitally for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network in September 2012 in Europe, and January 2014 in Asia.</p>
