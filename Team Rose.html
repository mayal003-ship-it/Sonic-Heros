		<p>Team Rose is a group that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is a team that was founded by Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Big the Cat to search for their missing friends during the incident with Neo Metal Sonic, whom Team Rose defeated alongside Team Sonic, Team Dark, and Team Chaotix at the end of their journey. Though not as active as the other teams, Team Rose has occasionally resurfaced with new members to join their friends' ongoing adventures.</p>
		<p>In Sonic Heroes, Amy, Big, Cream, and Cheese met each other by chance at the local news publisher. A quick exchange of stories revealed that all four of them were searching for someone; Amy was looking for her missing Sonic; Big was looking for his missing best friend Froggy; and Cream was looking for Cheese's missing twin, Chocola. Furthermore, the only clue they had to their friends' whereabouts was a picture of Sonic with Froggy and Chocola in the local newspaper.[1] As they pondered on their only clue, Amy nearly lost it to a breeze, but Big and Cream got it back. Regrouping, the quartet then set out to find their friends, forming Team Rose.</p>
