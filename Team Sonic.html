	<h1 id="Head">Team Sonic</h1>
		
		<p>Team Sonic also known as Team Heroes or Sonic Heroes, is a group in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It was founded by Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna at the beginning of the Neo Metal Sonic incident.</p>
		<p>Since then, the trio has reunited on various occasions to deal with other dangers or to just compete against other teams. With its primary members having at least one talent at which they excel, Team Sonic is a highly capable team who has overcome several threats to the world.</p>
		<p>In Sonic Heroes, the trio's members came together when Tails and Knuckles tracked Sonic down in order to show him a letter from Dr. Eggman, which said that in just three days time, the doctor would conquer the world with "the ultimate weapon" and that he challenged the trio to stop him. After receiving the letter, the hedgehog headed out with his friends right behind him to foil the doctor's plot, thereby officially forming Team Sonic.</p>
		<p>Seeking to stop Eggman before his deadline, the trio tracked "him" down to Ocean Palace. There, they defeated his Egg Hawk, but when he escaped, the heroes found him at Grand Metropolis. After liberating the city from the doctor's control and escaping the Power Plant, the crew came across Team Rose, who began fighting them.</p>
		<p>Eventually escaping the other team, the group continued their hunt for "Eggman". After overcoming the scientist and his robot army in the big city with only a day to spare, Team Sonic followed the doctor to Rail Canyon. Having only until sunset to stop their nemesis, the heroes hurried to the center of Bullet Station where they destroyed Eggman's base and defeated the scientist and his Egg Albatross. However, upon the doctor's defeat, they discovered that the Eggman they had been chasing was a fake and that their challenge letter was to distract them while the Egg Fleet was launched.</p>
		<p>Chasing after their adversary through the jungle, the trio encountered Team Dark, and they were amazed to see Shadow alive and well despite getting killed at the end of the Space Colony ARK incident. After the two teams fought to decide who went after Eggman, the trio pursued him and Team Dark to a spooky castle. After escaping a haunted mansion, Sonic and his crew overcame the doctor's next wave of robot henchmen, before going up to the Egg Fleet. After infiltrating the Final Fortress and destroying its core, the group found "Eggman" in his Egg Emperor and defeated him.</p>
		<p>Afterward, they set off a chain reaction that destroyed most of the fleet. With their mission complete, Sonic thanked his teammates before running away when he saw Amy arrive.</p>
		<p>Soon after, the trio and the other teams saw the appearance of Neo Metal Sonic, who had been staging the teams' adventures and impersonating Eggman so he could follow them and copy their data in an effort to conquer the world himself, as he transformed into Metal Madness. Seeing that the teams had all the Chaos Emeralds, the real Eggman came up with the plan of using them against his treacherous robot. Though their chances of winning were slim, Sonic volunteered to go up against Metal Sonic alone. Knuckles and Tails, however, joined the hedgehog's side while the other teams were willing to buy them some time.</p>
		<p>The crew thus got the Emeralds ready while Teams Rose, Dark, and Chaotix fought Metal Madness. By the time the robot turned into Metal Overlord, the trio had prepared the Emeralds and Sonic transformed into Super Sonic while also granting Tails and Knuckles their Super States as well, and the three followed Metal Overlord into the skies. Though their adversary proved nearly impervious, the heroes' unified power was able to inflict damage on the mechanical tyrant and eventually defeat him, sending him falling down from the sky. After celebrating their victory, the trio returned to Final Fortress and powered down to normal.</p>
		<p>Afterward, Sonic took his leave with Tails while Knuckles tried to stop Rouge from going after the Master Emerald. Regardless, the trio reunited soon after and headed out to find their next adventure.</p>
