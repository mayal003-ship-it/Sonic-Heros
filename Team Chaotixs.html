      <h1 id="Head">Team Chaotixs</h1>
		
		<p>Team Chaotix, often simply called the Chaotix are a group that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. They are a trio of detectives-for-hire consisting of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee who run the Chaotix Detective Agency.</p>
		<p>Despite being a goofy bunch and not as involved in the ongoing world-spanning conflicts as often as Sonic the Hedgehog and his other allies are, the Chaotix is nonetheless a competent trio when the need arises and are always ready to lend a hand in the face of danger.</p>
		<p>In Sonic Heroes, Vector, Espio and Charmy had officially come together to form what became known as Team Chaotix and operated their own business: the Chaotix Detective Agency. On one lazy day, Charmy arrived with a mysterious package that had been delivered to their agency. Inside the package, the Chaotix found a transceiver, which an unseen client used to talk to them. This client promised the three a handsome payment if they would take on a case. While Charmy was thrilled about the offer in contrast to Espio, who remained skeptical due to the strange nature of communication, Vector nevertheless had his team set out to follow their new client's requests.</p>
		<p>During their client's tests of their skills, the team ran into Dr. Eggman and his Egg Hawk. After making Eggman retreat, Team Chaotix arrived in Grand Metropolis where they cleared out the Badniks occupying it as their client requested. After then freeing the Power Plant from the control of Gold Camerons as instructed by their client, Team Chaotix met Team Dark, whom they fought after mistaking them as their client's adversaries. Afterward, the client tested Team Chaotix's luck and had them look for casino chips. Eventually, they met Eggman again, but overcame his robot horde. Afterward, Team Chaotix followed their client's instructions and infiltrated Eggman's base in the canyons where they destroyed some capsules. They then ran into Eggman and his Egg Albatross, which their client told them to destroy. Afterward, the trio discovered that the Eggman they fought was a fake, something their client was aware about. As the trio were instructed to head to the jungle, they began to wonder about their client's identity, which Vector was slowly able to piece together. After making it through the jungle undetected and protecting some Chao from Eggman's forces, the trio met Team Rose, whom they fought due to a miscommunication. Afterward, the trio was instructed to enter a castle with some keys. After then escaping a mansion, the trio had another run-in with Eggman and his robots. Eventually, the trio made it to the Egg Fleet, where the client instructed them to infiltrate the flagship and find the keys that would free him from captivity. Along the way, the trio defeated another fake Eggman and his Egg Emperor. Having deduced that their client was the real doctor, Vector busted him out of his prison so he and the trio could talk. Eggman told them that he would pay them after he conquered the world, only for Charmy to attack him for making promises he would not be able to keep.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Eggman revealed that he had been imprisoned and impersonated by his own creation, Metal Sonic, who had gone rogue and sought to conquer the world. The trio subsequently met up with the other teams (including Team Sonic, just as Neo Metal Sonic transformed into Metal Madness. Eggman then saw the teams had collected all the Chaos Emeralds and got the idea of using the Emeralds against Metal Sonic. Teams Rose, Chaotix and Dark then volunteered to stall Metal Madness with the others while Team Sonic prepared the Chaos Emeralds. Despite their efforts, Metal Madness transformed into Metal Overlord, but a super transformed Team Sonic then arrived and defeated him. Afterward, the Chaotix sought to get their payment, chasing after Eggman when the doctor tried running away from his promise.</p>
