      <h1 id="Head">Team Dark</h1>
		
		<p>Team Dark is a group that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is a team that was founded by Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, and E-123 Omega, all of whom joined forces to track down their common target: Dr. Eggman. Eventually meeting up with Team Sonic, Team Rose, and Team Chaotix, the trio assisted in the defeat of the rogue Metal Sonic. Consisting of highly powerful and fearsome individuals in their own right, Team Dark is a force to be reckoned with and has often appeared to contend with some of the world's greatest threats and champions.</p>
		<p>In Sonic Heroes, Rouge broke into one of Dr. Eggman's bases in search of his secret treasure. There, she found a stasis capsule and activated it. Unbeknownst to her, E-123 Omega was activated and slowly advanced toward Rouge and the capsule. Meanwhile, Rouge was shocked to find Shadow, who was presumed dead after the events on the Space Colony ARK, inside the pod. As Shadow awakened, Omega began attacking Shadow, believing him to be an Eggman robot. After saving Rouge from the spray of bullets, Shadow engaged Omega. Before things could escalate further though, Rouge stepped in to break up the fighting. Afterward, Rouge was able to piece together the whole story: Omega was mad at his creator for decommissioning and imprisoning him and now wanted to take revenge by destroying all Eggman's machinery, and Shadow had lost all his memories prior to his release from the stasis capsule. Seeing that their common target was Eggman, who had what they each wanted, Rouge had the trio form Team Dark so they could look for Eggman together.</p>
		<p>Shortly after starting their search, Team Dark found Eggman and his Egg Hawk. Although they defeated the Egg Hawk, Eggman got away. Pursuing Eggman to Grand Metropolis with renewed resolve, the team crushed the opposition in the city and escaped its Power Plant. Afterward, they met Team Chaotix, who they engaged in battle over an assumption Rouge made about them. After the fight, the three arrived in the casino area where they met Eggman again. Shadow asked Eggman about his past, but Eggman remarked that he had "no past to remember". Overcoming Eggman's horde of robots, the trio continued their pursuit and headed to his base at Bullet Station. After destroying it, the three faced the doctor and his Egg Albatross. Upon beating him however, the trio saw that the Eggman they had been chasing was a fake, much to Omega's fury. Furthermore, they found the remains of a Shadow Android, making them question whether Shadow was the genuine article or merely a replica. Continuing their hunt, the trio eventually came across Team Sonic and fought them to see which one of them got to go after Eggman. Afterward, the trio continued their hunt through a spooky castle mansion before coming across the doctor again. After overcoming another one of his robot swarms, the trio ventured to his headquarters among the Egg Fleet where they defeated him and his Egg Emperor. With Eggman seemingly destroyed, Omega considered his mission complete. Soon after, Rouge went looking for Eggman's treasure, only to find a warehouse full of Shadow Androids. As Omega prepared to destroy the warehouse, he reassured Rouge, who did not know if Shadow was real or not, that Eggman needed the original Shadow to make the Shadow Androids.</p>
		<p>Not long after, the trio (along with Teams Sonic, Chaotix and Rose) united to see Neo Metal Sonic reveal himself. As it turned out, Neo Metal Sonic, who had been impersonating Eggman, had been the mastermind staging the teams' adventures so he could copy their data for a plan to conquer the world himself. As Neo Metal Sonic transformed into Metal Madness, the real Eggman saw the teams had collected all the Chaos Emeralds and got the idea of using the Emeralds against Metal Sonic. The teams then volunteered to stall Metal Madness with the others while Team Sonic prepared the Chaos Emeralds. Despite their efforts, Metal Madness transformed into Metal Overlord, but a super transformed Team Sonic then arrived and defeated him. Afterward, the trio split up, with Rouge deciding to go after the Master Emerald, and Shadow and Omega staying behind with an inert Metal Sonic.</p>
